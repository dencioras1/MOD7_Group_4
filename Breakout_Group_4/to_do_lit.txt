Kaya:
1. Aesthetics (in italic)
2. Multiple lives
3. Press something to start the game, or maybe timer                    (BEFORE TMRW)
4. Win / Lose text
5. Keep track of score                                                  (BEFORE TMRW)

Denas:
1. Track scores (whoever breaks more bricks)
2. Player 1 (bottom) vs Player 2 (top) each one with their own ball     
3. Ball speeds up over time                                             (BEFORE TMRW)
4. Extend ball class to be connected to a player
5. Have three balls                                                     (BEFORE TMRW)

Both:                                                                   (BEFORE TMRW)
1. Comment code                                                         
2. Consistency of code style:
	Naming of variables 
	Naming of methods
	Indentation
	Empty lines after comments
	Parentheses after method calls
	ETC...
3. Constructors and attributes
	Make sure variable are declared outside the constructors and initialized in the constructor
4. Remove unused parameters and variables
