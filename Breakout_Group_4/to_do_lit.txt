5. Keep track of score                                                  (BEFORE TMRW)

3. Ball speeds up over time                                             (BEFORE TMRW)
4. Extend ball class to be connected to a player

1. Comment code                                                         
2. Consistency of code style:
	Naming of variables 
	Naming of methods
	Indentation
	Empty lines after comments
	Parentheses after method calls
	ETC...
3. Constructors and attributes
